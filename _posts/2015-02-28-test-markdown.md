A lot of people are not content with the amount of hours they sleep per night. Throughout your week, you might hear a few people complain that they are tired or they didn't sleep enough. You might even hear others express how energized they are for the day to begin. The truth is, sleep can dictate the way your day might lay out in front of you and even what you do before sleep contributes. 



****Data

I found my data off the website [https://www.kaggle.com/mlomuscio/sleepstudypilot](https://www.kaggle.com/mlomuscio/sleepstudypilot). This was a fantastic way to test my skills I've been learning. The csv.file I used contained a dataset with 104 observations and 6 columns of sleeping habits to determine if students were satisfied with the amount of sleep they get. Upon downloading this data and cleaning it up a bit, I was able to find out a few observations.

One night of short sleep can affect you the next day. Getting enough sleep is important, but good sleep quality is also essential. Signs of poor sleep quality include feeling sleepy or tired even after getting enough sleep, repeatedly waking up during the night, and having symptoms of sleep disorders. After cleaning the data and assigning 0 or 1 for yes and no, I was able to get a graph to see all of this data.  The purpose is to show the value for all the columns. I can see that majority of the people believe they do not get enough sleep. I also see that, most people typically eat breakfast in the morning and are on their phones before they sleep.

I wanted to see if there was a correlation with the amount of hours slept and if people were still tired. In this finding, I saw there was a small correlation and it's the more hours slept, the student was found to be a little less tired. The average amount of sleep a student has was 6 hours and 36 minutes. If students tend to sleep more than 7 hours or less than 6 hours, they also too are known to be more tired than the rest.

People will often cut back on their sleep for work, for family demands, or even to watch a good show on television. Sleep is a regular part of your routine, you may be at an increased risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease and stroke, poor mental health, and even early death. In this image below, I wanted to see if people were content with the amount of hours they were getting. 64 people insisted that they did not recieve enough sleep while 38 insisted they got enough rest.

Next, we can look at different ways we can effect our sleep by not even knowing. Keeping your phone on your nightstand may not seem like a big deal, but technology affects your sleep in more ways than you realize. We conducted a survey and we wanted to see how many people slept with their phone in arms reach and how many hours they slept. Reducing melatonin makes it harder to fall and stay asleep. Most Americans admit to using electronics a few nights a week within an hour before bedtime. But to make sure technology isn’t harming your slumber, give yourself at least 30 minutes of gadget-free transition time before hitting the hay.

Majority of the people had their phones in arms reach. 71 people said yes while 31 said no. You might be wondering now if you sleep with your phone in an arms reach. There is no major difference between hours slept if you had your phone near you or not. 



While you rest, your brain stays busy, it keeps your body running in top condition, preparing you for the day ahead. Without enough hours of sleep, you won’t be able to work, learn, create, and communicate at a level even close to your true potential. Regularly skimp on “service” and you’re headed for a major mental and physical breakdown. You may not be noticeably sleepy during the day, but losing even one hour of sleep can affect your ability to think properly and respond quickly.Some people sleep eight or nine hours a night but don’t feel well rested when they wake up because the quality of their sleep is poor. For adults, the correct hours needed for sleep are 7-9 hours. It's even appropriate to sleep for 6 hours. In the student survey, the mean of the people say they sleep for 6.6 hours. They are actually sleeping less than what the average hours of sleep is telling us. I want to see what were the hours people slept for this observation.
