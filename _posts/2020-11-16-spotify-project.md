## Data Engineer
 For this project, I was a data engineer. My tasks were to build a flask app and connect the model with the server. For this, I had to get spotify's api and connect with the flask api. This was my first experience working with api's. For this specific project, we hhad to get a song of our liking then, return the top 10 relatable tracks within the features of music.
