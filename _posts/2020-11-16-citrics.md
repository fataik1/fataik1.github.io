## Citrics Find A New Place To Live

For this project, I was assigned as a Data Engineer. My tasks were to find datasets, clean them, and find data for the job market, job industry, housing data, and weather. I cleaned the datasets and then did some feature engineering. After, I began creating visualizations for the weather and job data. I used the library plotly. This has many visuals to play with and it was easy to decide what was best for the project.
