## College is right around the corner!

Anyone who has ever been through the process of applying to college knows how stressful this time period can become. From the anxiety of waiting on the school of your dreams to answer on your admission or, to freaking out about choices you are unsure about. This process can hold a weight on you without even knowing it. The college process is definetly not an easy one. Now, we begin to think about the what gets us in these universities. Is it our work ethic, how much education knowledge we have, is there a placement test? All of these things can factor whether your likely to get into a school or not.


## Data

I found my data off the website  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement). In this dataset, there was 215 observations and 15 columns, we use all of the columns to evaluate a student's education history and to see if they are on the track to finally getting their masters.  The observations were a little low if you ask me. First I wanted to look at how gender compares to all of the columns.

From the image above, we notice that in this dataset, there are more Male observations than Females. Also to find interesting, Women in this dataset were found to have a higher: 2nd Education Percentage,	Higher 2nd Education, Degree Percentage, and Master Percentage then men. But Men had higher, employability test and	 the salary they receieve are higher than the women. From doing outside research and prior knowledge, I've heard about the gender wage gap. The wage gap is the average difference between the payment for men and women who are working. Women are generally considered to be paid less than men. 

I started off playing with the data. I wanted to do some feature engineering so I changed renamed most of the columns to get a better understanding of the data and then I wanted to see the correlation between salary and the other columns.
